# Sky Sherpa

The goal of Sky-Sherpa is to provide an all-in-one flight booking platform which looks and feels like a premium product.

To gain the most out this project, I'm trying to use as little as possible in the way of frameworks on both the frontend and backend.

While it would be great to attract authentic users to the platform, it's far from my main goal, the goal of Sky-Sherpa is for me to learn.

## Developing

To get the project running, navigate to the ./static/ folder and run:

```
npm run dev

```

That will create both a locally running backend server and a vite development server which will speak to each other (you'll have to provide your own database solution, however I'm using MariaDB).
